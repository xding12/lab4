			<!--Quick summary of langs & also their relation to the other two topics (phil & streaming)-->
			<p>Programming languages are used in computer programming to create programs that implement specific algorithms.  Most programming languages consist of instructions for computers, although there are programmable machines that use a limited set of specific instructions, rather than the general programming languages of modern computers.  A lot of the constructs seen in modern programming languages have their roots in logic, which has its roots in philosophy and mathematics.  Logic is essential to the creation of programming languages and thus the programs that can be built out of these languages. Programming languages and the programs that have resulted (e.g. streaming services) have disrupted a lot of industries, both for the bad and the good.</p>

			<h3>Background and Specific Instances</h3>
			<p>A programming language is a notation for writing programs, which are specifications of a computation or algorithm. Rather than dealing with registers, memory addresses and call stacks, high-level languages deal with variables, arrays, objects, complex arithmetic or boolean expressions, subroutines and functions, loops, threads, locks, and other abstract computer science concepts, with a focus on usability over optimal program efficiency. Thousands of different programming languages have been created, mainly in the computer field, and many more still are being created every year, but there are a handful, such as C++, Python, and Java that are popularly used by a lot of programmers, both for their strong logical background and their flexibility in creating new, dynamic programs and services.</p>

			<h3>C++</h3>
			<p>C++ is a general-purpose programming language. It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features, while also providing facilities for low-level memory manipulation. It was designed with a bias toward system programming and embedded, resource-constrained and large systems, with performance, efficiency and flexibility of use as its design highlights. C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications, including desktop applications, servers (e.g. e-commerce, Web search or SQL servers), and performance-critical applications (e.g. telephone switches or space probes). C++ is a compiled language, with implementations of it available on many platforms. Many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, Microsoft, Intel, and IBM.</p>

			<h3>Python</h3>
			<p>Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes code readability, notably using significant whitespace. It provides constructs that enable clear programming on both small and large scales.  Van Rossum led the language community until stepping down as leader in July 2018.  Python features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative, functional and procedural, and has a large and comprehensive standard library.  Python interpreters are available for many operating systems. CPython, the reference implementation of Python, is open source software and has a community-based development model, as do nearly all of Python's other implementations. Python and CPython are managed by the non-profit Python Software Foundation.</p>

			<h3>Java</h3>
			<p>Java is a general-purpose computer-programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented, and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers "write once, run anywhere" (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture. As of 2016, Java is one of the most popular programming languages in use, particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers. Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since been acquired by Oracle Corporation) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The language derives much of its original features from SmallTalk, with a syntax similar to C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them.</p>

			<h5>Impact on Modern Day</h5>
			<p>The ideas behind programming languages have been around for millenia, but it wasn't until the formalization of these ideas that programming languages could be born. The changes to the world as a result of the advent of programming languages is significant. Much of the 21st century could not be as it was without computer programs. Though the logic and understanding behind these languages goes back to Ancient Greek times, the formalization of these languages truly allowed rapid advancement in the field of Computer Science to occur.</p>
