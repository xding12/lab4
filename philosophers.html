			<h2>Philosophers</h2>
			<p>In the classical sense, a philosopher was someone who lived according to a certain way of life, focusing on resolving existential questions about the human condition, and not someone who discourses upon theories or comments upon authors. Typically, these particular brands of philosophy are Hellenistic ones and those who most arduously commit themselves to this lifestyle may be considered philosophers. A philosopher is one who challenges what is thought to be common sense, doesn’t know when to stop asking questions, and reexamines the old ways of thought.  Philosophy has an emphasis on reasoning and logic. Philosophers are probably substantial reasons for the formal creation of mathematics and computer science, leading to all of the wonderful creations we have today.</p>

			<h3>Background and Specific Instances</h3>
			<p>Most of western philosophy finds its roots in the teachings of three ancient Greek philosophers. A philosopher is one who challenges what is thought to be common sense, doesn’t know when to stop asking questions, and reexamines the old ways of thought.  The three vanguards of Hellenistic philosophy came from Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle.  They emphasized reasoning and the use of logic, tenaments important in Computer Science.  In a modern sense, a philosopher is an intellectual who has contributed in one or more branches of philosophy.</p>

			<h3>Socrates</h3>
			<p>Socrates (470 – 399 BC) was a classical Greek (Athenian) philosopher credited as one of the founders of Western philosophy, and as being the first moral philosopher, of the Western ethical tradition of thought. An enigmatic figure, he made no writings, and is known chiefly through the accounts of classical writers writing after his lifetime, particularly his students Plato and Xenophon. Other sources include the contemporaneous Antisthenes, Aristippus, and Aeschines of Sphettos. Aristophanes, a playwright, is the only source to have written during his lifetime.Plato's dialogues are among the most comprehensive accounts of Socrates to survive from antiquity, though it is unclear the degree to which Socrates himself is "hidden behind his 'best disciple'". Through his portrayal in Plato's dialogues, Socrates has become renowned for his contribution to the fields of ethics and epistemology.</p>


			<h3>Plato</h3>
			<p>Plato (348/347 BC) was a philosopher in Classical Greece and the founder of the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in the Western world. He is widely considered the pivotal figure in the development of Western philosophy, along with his teacher, Socrates, and his most famous student, Aristotle. In addition, Plato has also often been cited as one of the founders of Western religion and spirituality. Alfred North Whitehead once noted: "the safest general characterization of the European philosophical tradition is that it consists of a series of footnotes to Plato." Plato was the innovator of the written dialogue and dialectic forms in philosophy. His most famous contribution bears his name, Platonism (also ambiguously called either Platonic realism or Platonic idealism), the doctrine of the Forms to provide a realist solution to the problem of universals. Plato also appears to have been the founder of Western political philosophy, with his Republic, and Laws among other dialogues, providing some of the earliest extant treatments.</p>

			<h3>Aristotle</h3>
			<p>Aristotle (384–322 BC) was an ancient Greek philosopher and scientist born in the city of Stagira, Chalkidiki, Greece. Along with Plato, he is considered the "Father of Western Philosophy". Aristotle provided a complex and harmonious synthesis of the various existing philosophies prior to him, including those of Socrates and Plato, and it was above all from his teachings that the West inherited its fundamental intellectual lexicon, as well as problems and methods of inquiry. As a result, his philosophy has exerted a unique influence on almost every form of knowledge in the West and it continues to be central to the contemporary philosophical discussion. Little is known about his life. His father, Nicomachus, died when Aristotle was a child, and he was brought up by a guardian. At seventeen or eighteen years of age, he joined Plato's Academy in Athens and remained there until the age of thirty-seven (c. 347 BC). His writings cover many subjects – including physics, biology, zoology, metaphysics, logic, ethics, aesthetics, poetry, theatre, music, rhetoric, psychology, linguistics, economics, politics and government – and constitute the first comprehensive system of Western philosophy.</p>

			<h5>Impact on Modern Day</h5>
			<p>Philosophers such as Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle have impacted the domain of knowledge for centuries, and their reach is having a large hand in the technological landscape as well.  The original Hellenistic thoughts of philosophy have been expanded in numerous ways today, their implications reaching far beyond the domain of philosophy.  Numerous fields have been affected, notably mathematics and computer science. The thoughts and ideas of these three men would shape western civilization for thousands of years to come. Although they were distinct characters, they were closely related as teachers and disciples.</p>
