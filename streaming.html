		<h2>Streaming Services</h2>

		<aside>
			<p>Advances in computer networking, combined with powerful home computers and modern operating systems, made streaming media practical and affordable for ordinary consumers. Streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, and YouTube TV are relatively new, boosted by the advent of the Web.  They are a creation that have changed the current media landscape, giving users a new way to consume television shows and movies. All of these services have created their own original content fueled by user data and algorithms, different from the media consumed several decades ago. As with other tools accessible through computers and cell phones, streaming services could not have been built without their tools (programming languages), going back to the logic epoused by philosophers.</p>

			<h3>Impact on Modern Day</h3>
			<p>One of the movie streaming industry’s largest impacts was on the DVD industry, which effectively met its demise with the mass popularization of online content. The rise of media streaming caused the downfall of many DVD rental companies such as Blockbuster. In July 2015 the New York Times published an article about Netflix's DVD services. It stated that Netflix was continuing their DVD services with 5.3 million subscribers, which was a significant drop from the previous year. On the other hand, their streaming services had 65 million members.[23] In a March 2016 study assessing the “Impact of Movie Streaming over traditional DVD Movie Rental” it was found that respondents did not purchase DVD movies nearly as much anymore, if at all, as streaming had taken over the market.</p>
