# Lab 4: Information Architecture

------

We were once :crown:**Queens**:crown:, and we are now :fire:**Hell, Michigan**:fire:!

The goal of this lab is to fork another team's website and to try to improve it.  We'll be taking the original *Hell's* Assignment 3 (which dealt with programming languages, philosphers, and streaming services) and putting our own spin on it.

## Roles

- Information Architect: [Maisha Idris](https://github.com/maishaidris)
- Designer: [Chadia Bedetse](https://github.com/bchadia)
- Coder: [Xiabo (Sharon) Ding](https://github.com/xding12)

Ontology, taxonomy, and choreography to be decided soon!

## Rough Outline of Information Architecture

- Domain: influential topics
- Choreography: It's arguable that philosophers (with a focus on logic) have led to the creation of programming languages.  These programming languages shaped the creation of these streaming services.  That's the ordering 

### Possible Ontology

- Each topic has a name
- Each topic has a background
- Each topic has a date of creation
- Each topic has an impact on modern day.

### Areas of Improvement

- The index page is a big block of text that can be broken down
- The index page is currently full of filler text; this can be modified to showcase the content
- There are no images on this site at all
- The nav bar at the bottom is not conducive or obvious to a user
- The subheadings within each page should be changed to reflect the improved taxonomy
