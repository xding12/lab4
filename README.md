# Lab 4: Information Architecture

We were once :crown:**Queens**:crown:, and we are now :fire:**Hell, Michigan**:fire:!

The goal of this lab is to fork another team's website and to try to improve it.  We'll be taking the original *Hell's* Assignment 3 (which dealt with programming languages, philosphers, and streaming services) and putting our own spin on it.

## Roles

- Information Architect: [Maisha Idris](https://github.com/maishaidris)
- Designer: [Chadia Bedetse](https://github.com/bchadia)
- Coder: [Xiabo (Sharon) Ding](https://github.com/xding12)

Ontology, taxonomy, and choreography to be decided soon!

## Rough Outline of Information Architecture

- Domain: influential idea makers & ideas
- Choreography: It's arguable that philosophers (with a focus on logic) have led to the creation of programming languages.  These programming languages shaped the creation of streaming services.  That's how the site will be ordered (in the order of how things affected each other).  Philosophers -> programming languages -> streaming services

### Ontology

- Each topic has a name.
- Each topic has a background.
- Each topic has a date of creation.
- Each topic has specific instances/examples.
- Each topic has an impact on modern day.

### Possible taxology

- Name
- Background
- Date of creation
- Specific instances/examples
- Impact on Modern Day

### Areas of Improvement (from Original Team's Assignment)

- The index page is a big block of text that can be broken down.
- The index page is currently full of filler text; this can be modified to showcase the content.
- There are no images on this site at all.
- The nav bar at the bottom is not conducive or obvious to a user.  Maybe it can be moved to the top.
- The subheadings within each page should be changed to reflect the improved ontology.
