# Lab 4: Information Architecture

We were once :crown:**Queens**:crown:, and we are now :fire:**Hell, Michigan**:fire:!

The goal of this lab is to fork another team's website and to try to improve it.  We'll be taking the original *Hell's* Assignment 3 (which dealt with programming languages, philosphers, and streaming services) and putting our own spin on it.

## Roles

- Information Architect: [Maisha Idris](https://github.com/maishaidris)
- Designer: [Chadia Bedetse](https://github.com/bchadia)
- Coder: [Xiabo (Sharon) Ding](https://github.com/xding12)

## Information Architecture
IA broken into domain, choreography, ontology, and taxology.

### Domain

Influential idea makers & the ideas that resulted.  


### Choreography
It's arguable that philosophers (with a focus on logic) have led to the creation of programming languages.  These programming languages shaped the creation of streaming services.  That's how the site will be ordered (in the order of how things affected each other).  Philosophers -> programming languages -> streaming services.  

Within each page, the specific examples are ordered by date of creation (e.g. Socrates -> Plato -> Aristotle or Netflix -> Hulu -> YouTube TV).  All ordering found overall is chronological.

### Ontology

- Each topic has a name.
- Each topic has specific instances/examples of that topic.
- Each topic has a background, and within that, each specific instance has a background.
- Each specific instance of the topic has a date of creation.
- Each topic has an impact on modern life.

### Taxology

- Name of Topic
- Background and Specific Instances
- Dates of Creation
- Impact on Modern Day

## Areas of Improvement (from Original Team's Assignment)

- The index page is a big block of text that can be broken down.
- The index page is currently full of filler text; this can be modified to showcase the content.
- There are no images on this site at all.
- The nav bar at the bottom is not conducive or obvious to a user.  Maybe it can be moved to the top.
- The subheadings within each page should be changed to reflect the improved ontology.
