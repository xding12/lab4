			It's amazing to think about how things have changed from philosphers idealizing about the implications of logic, to the development of programming languages, and then the creation of amazing technologies such as streaming services.

				<h2>Philosophers</h2>
				<p>
					A philosopher is one who challenges what is thought to be common sense, doesnâ€™t know when to stop asking questions, and reexamines the old ways of thought.  The three vanguards of Hellenistic philosophy came from Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle.  They emphasized reasoning and the use of logic, tenaments important in Computer Science.  The original Hellenistic thoughts of philosophy have been expanded in numerous ways today, their implications reaching far beyond the domain of philosophy.  Numerous fields have been affected, notably mathematics and computer science.  Philosophers such as Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle have impacted the domain of knowledge for centuries, and their reach is having a large hand in the technological landscape as well.

				<h2>Programming Languages</h2>
				<p>
					This paragraph will give a general overview of what programming languages have done and how philosophers (logic) have led to this.  It will also mention the ontology (name, background, date of creation and impact).  Then, it will relate this content to the other two.  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
