		<aside>
			It's amazing to think about how things have changed from philosphers idealizing about the implications of logic, to the development of programming languages, and then the creation of amazing technologies such as streaming services.

				<h2>Philosophers</h2>
				<p>
					A philosopher is one who challenges what is thought to be common sense, doesnâ€™t know when to stop asking questions, and reexamines the old ways of thought.  The three vanguards of Hellenistic philosophy came from Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle.  They emphasized reasoning and the use of logic, tenaments important in Computer Science.  The original Hellenistic thoughts of philosophy have been expanded in numerous ways today, their implications reaching far beyond the domain of philosophy.  Numerous fields have been affected, notably mathematics and computer science.  Philosophers such as Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle have impacted the domain of knowledge for centuries, and their reach is having a large hand in the technological landscape as well.

				<h3>Programming Languages</h3>
				<p>
					A programming language is a formal language, which comprises a set of instructions used to produce various kinds of output. Logic programming is a type of programming paradigm which is largely based on formal logic. Any program written in a logic programming language is a set of sentences in logical form, expressing facts and rules about some problem domain. A lot of the constructs seen in modern programming languages, like C++, Python, and Java, have their roots in logic, which has its roots in philosophy and mathematics.  Logic is essential to the creation of programming languages and thus the programs that can be built out of these languages.

				<h4>Streaming Services</h4>
				<p>
					Streaming services provide multimedia that is constantly received by and presented to an end-user while being delivered by a provider. The verb "to stream" refers to the process of delivering or obtaining media in this manner; the term refers to the delivery method of the medium, rather than the medium itself, and is an alternative to file downloading. Streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, and YouTube TV are relatively new, boosted by the advent of the Web.  They are a creation that have changed the current media landscape, giving users a new way to consume television shows and movies. As with other tools accessible through computers and cell phones, streaming services could not have been built without their tools (programming languages), going back to the logic epoused by philosophers.
